# Hi! I'm-Ethan! 
Hello! I am a thirteen year-old developer named Ethan Adam (or Ethan Minja) and this is my repository!

# What I'm working on
1. LandLog - A simple C++ logging library
2. Consel - A tiny programming language!

# The languages i use
1. Python - I'm pretty experienced with python, although I almost never use it!
2. C - My favourite language! I use it alot!
3. C++ - My second favourite! I use it more than C tho...
4. HTML - I know a rather intermidiate(ish) chunk of HTML(Although i use Python more)
5. Pascal - I just started learning it!
6. LUA - The one and only reason to why i use LUA is because of a build system known as premake!(https://github.com/premake/premake-core)
7. Consel - Now this is a language that I'M creating!!!
